-- Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

-- "Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
-- "Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
-- "High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.
-- The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

SELECT "Low Salary" AS category,
       sum(income < 20000) AS accounts_count
  FROM Accounts

UNION

SELECT "Average Salary" AS category,
       sum(income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000) AS accounts_count
  FROM Accounts

UNION

SELECT "High Salary" AS category,
       sum(income > 50000) AS accounts_count
  FROM Accounts;
